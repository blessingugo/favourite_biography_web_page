					David Adedeji Adeleke (born 21 November 1992), popularly known as Davido, is a American-born Nigerian singer, songwriter and record producer. His music blends traditional African elements with global mainstream pop.[1][2][3]

					Davido won the Next Rated award in 2012 at The Headies after releasing "Dami Duro", the second single from his debut studio album Omo Baba Olowo(2012).[4] Between 2013 and 2015, he released a number of hit singles, and in January 2016, he signed a record deal with Sony Music. He then founded the record label Davido Music Worldwide (DMW), to which acts Dremo, Mayorkun, Peruzzi and Liya have been signed. In July 2016, Davido signed a record deal with Sony's RCA Records. In October 2016, he released the 5-track EP Son of Mercy, which was supported by the singles "Gbagbe Oshi", "How Long" and "Coolest Kid in Africa". In April 2017, Davido re-negotiated his contract with Sony due to creative control issues and later that year he released five singles including "If" and "Fall".[5] "If" generated worldwide social media activity while "Fall" became the longest-charting Nigerian pop song in Billboard history.[5][6] Davido has been famously referred to as 'The king of modern-day afrobeats'.[7][8]

					Davido released, his second studio album A Good Time in November 2019, supported by singles including "Blow My Mind" featuring popular American singer Chris Brown . Davido was cited as one of the Top 100 most influential Africans by New African magazine in 2019.[9] He released his third studio album A Better Time, on Friday November 13, 2020.

					In anticipation to his birthday (21 November 2021) the afrobeat singer Davido took to his Instagram story to ask colleagues to each send him a million naira. Davido noted that he received N200m from fans and friends and added N50million. He donated N250million to all orphanages across Nigeria. The singer made this known in a statement ahead of the birthday. To disburse the money, he constituted a 5-man committee to take care of the logistics.[10]

					In March 2022, Davido was featured on "Hayya Hayya (Better Together)" along side (Trinidad Cardona and AISHA) the first single of the multi-song FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ Official Soundtrack. It marked Davido as the first Nigerian singer to be featured in a FIFA World Cup single.
